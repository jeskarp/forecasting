## Preparing the full dataset for analysis

In my forecasting folder, I have a folder called simulations, in which I hold all of my simulation data. Each simulation has its own folder, and from these folders I want a .csv file called "full_proj_metrics.csv". I want to put all of these csvs together to make a massive table.

```{r collate_csvs}
library(data.table)

setwd("/home/evelina/Development/forecasting/simulations/")

# list all files in directory named full_proj_metrics.csv
output_files <- list.files("/home/evelina/Development/forecasting/simulations/", pattern = "full_proj_metrics.csv", 
                           full.names = TRUE, recursive = TRUE)

# read and row bind all data sets
combo_table <- rbindlist(lapply(output_files, fread))
```
