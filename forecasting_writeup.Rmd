# Introduction

## Branching process models

From project description:

Branching process models are commonly used as an alternative to compartmental models for estimating transmissibility during infectious disease outbreaks. Such approaches are now increasingly used for informing outbreak response.  However, their actual ability to accurately predict the course of an epidemic in real time has not been evaluated.

## Methods for epidemic forecasting

### [earlyR](http://www.repidemicsconsortium.org/earlyR)

Can estimate reproduction numbers and force of infection over time from incidence.

Information required:

* distribution of serial interval (mean and SD of Gamma distribution)
* daily incidence of disease (confirmed and probable cases)

### [epitrix](http://www.repidemicsconsortium.org/epitrix/)

Can estimate reproduction numbers from growth rate/incidence.

Information required:

* daily incidence of disease

### [projections](https://github.com/reconhub/projections)

Can generate projections when given the current incidence data, a serial interval distribution, and some reproduction numbers.

Information required:

* daily incidence
* serial interval
* reproduction number

## Aims

I will use both publicly available empirical data and simulated epidemics to assess the performances of currently available methods provided by the R Epidemics Consortium for forecasting incidence. The methods will be compared for different diseases. The impact of factors such as under-reporting, reporting delays, or super-spreading will also be considered. The methods' performance in the early stages of epidemics is of particular interest.
